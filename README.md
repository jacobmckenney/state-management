# State Management Side Project

Used this project as an opportunity to try to build a [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) like system as
well as learn how to setup a React project from scratch using tools like
webpack and babel. Additionally, allowed me to get practice using typescript and wrap
my head around all of the different aspects that go into a React application. Had
primarily just been working with Next.JS apps prior to this which abstracts away
a lot of the nitty gritty aspects of working with/building & serving React apps.
